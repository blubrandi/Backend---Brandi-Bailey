# Lambda School Build Week -- RePlate    
## Backend By Brandi Bailey
This Github Repo is the backend for Lambda RePlate Build Week.

I'm Brandi, and I attend Lambda School.  I'm currently in my Backend Build Week and have utilized Node.js and Express to build out the backend for this project.

The backend is hosted at:  
https://replate-lambda.herokuapp.com/

API Documentation can be found at:  
https://replate-endpoints.netlify.com/

This is a collaborative project.  Feel free to explore the organization for the marketing pages and frontend that were created by fellow students.

#### More Info...

Approximately 5 weeks prior to this backend launch (April 2019), I worked on this same project with another group as a front-end.  I will fork that project and make adjustments to connect to this backend.  Link will be provided in the coming days/weeks, as time allows.
